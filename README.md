### Local Setup:
```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ADITYAVOFFICIAL/momcare-ai # Use your actual repo URL
cd adityavofficial-momcare-ai

# 2. Install dependencies (Frontend - assumes you are in the root directory)
bun install # or npm install / yarn install

# 3. Set up environment variables (Frontend)
# Create the .env.development.local file in the root as described above

# 4. Setup & Run Backend WebSocket Service (Fluvio Consumer)
#    (Requires separate terminal)
cd momcare-backend
bun install # or npm install / yarn install
# Create a .env file inside momcare-backend with necessary keys
# (APPWRITE_*, FLUVIO_ACCESS_KEY or VITE_PUBLIC_FLUVIO_ACCESS_KEY, WEBSOCKET_PORT)
bun run dev # or bun run start (Check package.json scripts)
cd .. # Go back to the root directory

# 5. Setup Appwrite Functions (Requires separate setup & deployment)
# --- Deploy Appwrite Functions (use Appwrite CLI or Console) ---
# a) Deploy the Forum Event Handlers:
#    - Navigate to appwrite-functions/produceForumPostEvent, set up env vars (API Key, Fluvio Key etc.), deploy.
#    - Navigate to appwrite-functions/produceForumVoteEvent, set up env vars, deploy.
# b) Deploy the User Count Function:
#    - Navigate to functions/getUserCount, set up env vars (API Key), deploy.
# c) Ensure functions are triggered by the correct Appwrite Database events.
#    (Refer to Appwrite documentation for function deployment)

# 6. Start the development server (Frontend - assumes you are in the root directory)
bun run dev # or npm run dev / yarn dev
```

The frontend application should now be running on http://localhost:8080 (as configured in vite.config.ts).
Most backend functionality (Auth, DB, Storage) is handled by Appwrite Cloud, but the momcare-backend service must be running separately to handle real-time forum updates via Fluvio. The Appwrite Functions also need to be deployed to Appwrite Cloud.
