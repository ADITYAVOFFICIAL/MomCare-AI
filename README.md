## üß™ How to Run the Project

### Requirements:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later recommended)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (Used for package management, `npm` or `yarn` can also be used)
- API Keys for Appwrite, Groq, and potentially Google Maps.
- `.env.development.local` file setup (copy `.env.example` if provided, or create one based on required environment variables like `VITE_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT`, `VITE_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID`, `VITE_PUBLIC_GROQ_API_KEY`, etc. - see [`src/lib/appwrite.ts`](src/lib/appwrite.ts) and [`src/utils/appwriteConfig.ts`](src/utils/appwriteConfig.ts)).

### Local Setup:
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/your-team/MomCare-AI-Dayzero # Replace with your actual repo URL

# Install dependencies
cd MomCare-AI-Dayzero
bun install # or npm install / yarn install

# Set up environment variables
# Create a .env.development.local file and add your API keys/config
# Example:
# VITE_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1
# VITE_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_PROJECT_ID
# VITE_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_BLOG_DATABASE_ID=YOUR_DATABASE_ID
# VITE_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_FORUM_TOPICS_COLLECTION_ID=YOUR_TOPICS_COLLECTION_ID
# ... other Appwrite IDs ...
# VITE_PUBLIC_GROQ_API_KEY=YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY

# Start development server
bun run dev # or npm run dev / yarn dev
```

The application should now be running on `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if specified). The backend is handled by Appwrite Cloud.
